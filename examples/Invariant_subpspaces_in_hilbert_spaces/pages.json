So, if Case II happens every time we obtain convergence to\na non-cyclic vector.\n    Now we will study the change of [ ]-1 x0 when we make the change y → y(1 + δ) and\nwhen we make the change y → y + αT j y, α a small complex number.\n    If A is an invertible operator the first order change of A−1 when we make the change\nA → A + B is A−1 → A−1 − A−1BA−1, y → y(1 + δ) gives in first order\n               [ ]-1 x0 → [ ]-1 x0 − 2δ [ ]-1 VyV∗[ ]-1 x0 = [ ]-1 x0 − 2δ([ ]−1 − [ ]−2)x0.\n                                                              y\n\nWith ⟨[ ]-1 x0, Tmy⟩ = am and ⟨[ ]−2x0, Tmy⟩ = bm we get\n                                               X amTmy = x0 − [ ]-1 x0\n                                           2δ X bmTmy = 2δ([ ]-1 −[ ]−2)x0\nRemark. We can think of Case II happening every time as a singular situation. Every\ntime we move y closer to x0 by a new minimal ℓ(T ), say ℓ1δ(T ), ℓ1δ(T ) will just be near\nto ℓ(T ) + 2δI and ℓ1δ(T )y will be near to ℓ(T )y + 2δy. However, ℓ1δ(T )y will also be\nnear to             x0 − [ ]-1 x0 + 2δ([ ]-1 −[ ]−2)x0 =X amT my + 2δ X bmTmy.\nSo this shows that bm is near 0 for m ≥ 1 and ([ ]-1 −[ ]−2)x0 is almost collinear with y.\nEquation (25) can be sharpened by a similar argument as above with Case I and Case\nII, with the conclusion that we either have a non-cyclic vector or there are at least 4\ndifferent j’s, bigger than 1, say j1, j2, j3, j4 such that |aj1 |, |aj2 |, |bj3 |, |bj4 | are all bigger\nthan (εθ)30.",
