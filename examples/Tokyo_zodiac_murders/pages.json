I wanted to ask the shopkeeper if I could buy her, but my shyness wouldn’t allow me to do such a thing.\n\nI called her Tokie, because she looked like an actress I adored who had that name. I grew obsessed with Tokie. I dedicated poems to her. Her face was always in my mind. And I drew portraits of her from memory. That was really the beginning of my life as a painter. I would stand just to the side of the shop window and pretend I was watching the unloading of raw silk at the wholesale store next door. Secretly, of course, I was staring at the doll. She had frizzy brown hair, delicate fingers, and slender legs that I could see below the hem of her skirt. Her face had a certain elegance. Even now, I can recall exactly what she looked like.\n\nOne day, I happened to see Tokie naked while the shopkeeper was changing her clothes. My knees trembled and I almost fainted. No other woman has ever left me feeling that way. The experience had a tremendous effect on my sexuality. Female sex organs covered with pubic hair lost all their attraction. And I began to prefer women with coarse, curly hair. I also started taking an admittedly perverse interest in mute girls and female corpses.\n\nBut my love affair with Tokie came to a sudden end. One warm spring morning, when I arrived at the boutique, she was gone from the window. My feelings could not be put into words. I was heartbroken.

Their souls lost their freedom and they became self-suppressive. Then they imported Buddhism from China, but that didn’t take root, either.

This small type is killing my eyes.”\n\n“Oh, come on, stop complaining!”\n\n“Can’t you just give me a rough idea?”\n\n“All right. I suppose you want an outline of the crimes first?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Ready?”\n\n“Just do it…”\n\n“Well, the so-called ‘Tokyo Zodiac Murders’ actually consist of three separate cases. The first was the murder of Heikichi Umezawa; the second was the murder of Kazue Kanemoto, his stepdaughter; and the third was the Azoth multiple murders. Heikichi was found dead in his",

He was a writer who wrote essays for\ntravel magazines, serialized novels for newspapers, features, etc. When\nhis elder brother was killed, he was up in the north-east in Tohoku, doing\nresearch for an article.

The uneven distribution of the weight would have made it obvious.\n\n“Anyway, enough about the question of shoe prints—which is far from the most interesting aspect of Heikichi’s murder. As he mentioned himself, he’d installed iron bars over his windows and skylights. He was a cautious man. The bars had not been tampered with in any way. For security purposes, they had been designed to be removed from the inside.\n\n“Therefore, there was only one way to enter the studio, and that was through the door.

He went there quite often and got to know two regulars: Genzo Ogata, who was the owner of a mannequin factory, and Tamio Yasukawa, one of Ogata’s employees. But they were not particularly close friends. Another acquaintance sometimes visited the studio, but you couldn’t call him a close friend, either.”\n\n“What about Yoshio? Or Heitaro? They knew Heikichi pretty well.”\n\n“Their alibis checked out, although they didn’t have many witnesses. On the night of the 25th, Heitaro played cards with his mother Yasue and some friends who came by after the doors of the gallery were closed. The guests left at 10.20, and mother and son went to their bedrooms upstairs at about 10.30. If Heitaro was the killer, he would’ve had to speed over to Heikichi’s studio in thirty or forty minutes to do the deed. Even without snow, it’s hard to get from Ginza to Meguro that fast; in heavy snow, it’s impossible. However, if Heitaro had conspired with Yasue to kill Umezawa, they might have bolted out of the gallery right after their friends left. So they could have made it within the presumed time frame of the murder. But what would have been their motive? Heitaro might have resented Heikichi—if he was his father—for his irresponsibility and the agony he had caused Yasue. Yasue, on the other hand, had no reason to hate Heikichi; she was quite close to him, and they were business partners. And she was his art dealer. Heikichi’s paintings sold for very high prices after his death, especially after the end of the war. Yasue had no contract with Heikichi, so she didn’t profit—and wouldn’t have profited—from his death.”\n\n“Uh-huh.”",

She was divorced and\nliving alone in Kaminoge, which was a rather remote town at that time.\nShe also had no alibi.

Heikichi was a chain-smoker, so there were cigarette butts in the ashtray. And there were fingerprints—some his, some his brother’s, others unidentifiable, maybe from the models he used. There was no sign of any attempt to wipe off fingerprints.”\n\n“Uh-huh.”\n\n“And no murder weapon was found.

It may seem awful to say this, but it looked like a run-of-the-mill murder, probably by a burglar. Her rooms had been ransacked, and valuables and money had been stolen from her drawers. Even though the killer seemed oblivious to details, he had wiped her blood off the vase with a cloth or a piece of paper. If he had wanted to destroy evidence, he could have taken the vase with him, but it was left on the floor in the next room to where she was found.”\n\n“Uh-huh. And what did the police and all the amateur detectives have to say?”\n\n“They thought that he tried to wipe off his fingerprints.”\n\n“I see. But what if the vase wasn’t used as a weapon?”\n\n“There’s no possibility of that. The indentation on Kazue’s head fit the shape of the vase perfectly.”\n\n“You suggested it was a man, Kazumi. But perhaps the killer was a woman. It would be more natural for a woman to clean the blood off unconsciously, and return the vase to its original place.”\n\n“Ah, but there’s strong evidence against that!” I replied. “The killer was definitely a man, because Kazue had been raped.”\n\n“Umm…”\n\n“It seems that she was raped after she was killed. The semen found in her vagina was from a man with blood type O. Among the people closely related to the case, only two were males: Yoshio, who was blood type A, and Heitaro, who was in fact blood type O. However, Heitaro had an alibi between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. on 23rd March.",
        "md": "Case, investigators discovered a house in Yoshio’s photos that wasn’t completed until October 1935, so his alibi was confirmed. Isn’t that dramatic? It was one of the highlights of the case.\n\n“Hmm, then Yoshio’s alibi is firm. He wasn’t killed in place of Heikichi.”\n\n“Well, you can say that for now. Let’s go on to the next murder.

Anyway, please describe the circumstances of her case.”\n\n“OK. Look at the plan of her house.”",
        "md": "“Right.”\n\n“I think—or perhaps I want to think—that Kazue’s murder occurred by coincidence.”\n\n“You don’t think that her house was used as a studio?”\n\n“No, I don’t… Although I suppose it does have the makings of a great horror novel: a deranged artist creating Azoth in a haunted house in the dark of night. Very Gothic! But, practically speaking, he couldn’t work in the dark. If he worked by candlelight, the neighbours would know something was going on and report it to the police. If I was the artist, I’d find a different house—one that was unknown and didn’t have a reputation. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to concentrate and wouldn’t be able to enjoy my wonderful creation!”\n\n“I agree,” Kiyoshi said. “But many people still believe that Azoth was created in Kazue’s house, don’t they?”\n\n“Yes, they believe her murder was part of the plan.”\n\n“But if the killer’s blood type was O, and he wasn’t Heitaro, he had to be someone outside the family… So, presumably, Kazue’s case wasn’t solved?”\n\n“That’s right.”\n\n“Why couldn’t the police catch a burglar?”\n\n“It’s not so unusual, if you think about it. Suppose we went to Hokkaido, killed an old lady and stole her money. The police would probably never find us because we have no connection to her. Many such cases remain unsolved. On the other hand, suspects of premeditated murders have motives that can be examined, so it comes down to confirming alibis. One reason why these murders remain a mystery is that nobody had a motive for the Azoth murders except Heikichi—who had already been murdered himself. I don’t want to believe that the crimes were committed by an outsider. It’s not at all exciting.”\n\n“So that’s why you believe Kazue’s case was a coincidence? I see.

After Kazue’s funeral, the Umezawa women all\njourneyed to the shrine at Mount Yahiko in Niigata Prefecture. They were\nhoping their visit would have the effect of purifying them. If you\nremember, it was the shrine that Heikichi had wanted to visit, and the\nfamily hoped that the journey there would put his soul to rest.

        "md": "Kiyoshi pored over the details for a few moments.\n\n“Look, it may seem only natural,” he said, “but the deeper they were buried, the later they were found. The one that was abandoned on the ground was found first. Perhaps that was the killer’s intention? I think that the bodies were found in the order that the killer planned. Now what could he have meant by that? Hmm… There are two possibilities: one, it would have helped the culprit cover his crime; two, the order might have been related to astrology or alchemy, which Heikichi was obsessed with. The first was Aquarius, the second Scorpio, then Aries, Cancer, Sagittarius, Virgo… No, I take that back. There doesn’t seem to be any astrological order… or any relationship between the order and the geography… Wait, wasn’t the one buried closest to Tokyo found first? No, I’m wrong… It seems there’s no meaning to the order after all.”\n\n“I must admit I don’t think the order is important, either,” I said. “The killer could have been planning to bury all six bodies, but got tired. The holes he dug got shallower and shallower, and finally Tomoko was thrown out on the ground. Couldn’t we trace the killer’s trail from that point of view?”\n\n“The deepest ones were in Hyogo and Nara—which aren’t so far apart—but another deep hole was found in Akita, and that’s a long way away.”\n\n“Yeah, that throws a bit of a wrench in that theory, doesn’t it?

From a geographical perspective, the towns of Hakone and Okitsu are located equidistant, to the east and the west, of longitude 138° 48’ E. Also, the village of Gonda, where Oguri was born, is located at longitude 138° 48’ E. Oguri was later caught there by the enemy, beheaded and buried—all at longitude 138° 48’ E. Reportedly, Oguri buried a considerable amount of the government’s treasury on Mount Akagi, at longitude 139° 12’ E. Akimitsu says the place Oguri chose must be somewhere between Matsuida and Gonda. If he’s right, that would be very close to longitude 138° 48’ E.\n\nThe coincidences don’t stop, do they?\n\nNo, they don’t.

We don’t know if the fortune-tellers of old intentionally chose the centre of the country as the place for making their prophecies, but it now seems that Heikichi’s ideas were not totally absurd.\n\nNo, obviously not.\n\nThen there’s the novel A Golden Key, by Akimitsu Takagi.\n\nWhich has something to say about this same longitude?\n\nWell, it’s a little bit complicated. The novel focused on the fall of Edo. At the time, two politicians were in charge—Katsu Kaishu and Oguri Kozukenosuke. Katsu was the cautious one, but Oguri, despite Edo’s weak army, was ready to attack the allied forces of Satsuma and Choshu. Katsu’s caution won out, but when Saigo Takamori, the Satsuma general, learnt about Oguri’s strategy later, he shuddered. Oguri’s strategy went like this: Edo would pull its army back to Hakone and Odawara, letting the allied forces advance to the east on the Tokaido coast. At Hakone, where Edo’s modern battleships were waiting near the shore, Edo would make its stand, pushing the enemy back to Okitsu, a town on a narrow strip between a mountain ridge and the sea.

He paid for it by dying young.”\n\nThere was another moment of silence, but the ice seemed to have been broken.\n\nWhen Mrs Iida started speaking, her words flowed smoothly. “The story includes some facts that could be rather shameful for my father. He died last month, and I’m afraid that things could escalate into criminal liability if the authorities start to ask about his involvement. My husband and elder brother could get into big trouble because—like my father was—they are police officers. I don’t mean that my father was a criminal. He was a very honest man. He received awards and was given a testimonial dinner when he retired. He was always punctual and never missed a day at the office. However, I happened to find out about a shocking incident which he was involved in a long time ago.\n\n“I have come here of my own accord. My husband is a rather conservative man like my father was, but my brother is not. He has an aggressive streak, and he can be ruthless and cold-hearted. Thinking of what my father must have gone through, I can’t let him handle this. The case is notorious enough. If someone can solve this case without my father’s honour getting smeared, it would be the best for everyone.”",

At the time of the incident, I had been promoted to section chief, so I would leave for the office at six every morning and return home a little after seven every evening by the same route. One day, I got off work as usual and, arriving in Kaminoge, began my walk home. After about five minutes, I saw a woman in a dark kimono walking ahead of me. There was nobody else on the street. Suddenly she squatted down. She was holding her stomach, so I asked her if she was all right. She said she was in acute pain, so I helped her get home, which was not far from there.\n\nWhen I was about to leave, she asked me to stay with her for a while because she was alone. She lay down on the floor, twisting her body in agony. Her kimono got bunched up around her knees, exposing her thighs. I could see between her legs; she wasn’t wearing any underwear. Honestly, I had never had an extramarital affair and I had no intention of having one with this woman, but, to my shame, I could feel myself losing control.\n\nShe leant on me and held me, repeatedly whispering how lonely she was. In a sad voice, she asked me not to turn on the light. When we were done, she apologized over and over again. Then she said, “Please leave the light off and go home. Your wife will worry if you come home late. I was just feeling lonely. Please forget about me. I won’t tell anyone about you.” I put my clothes on in the dark and left.\n\nWalking home, I thought about what I had just done, but everything was like a dream. Acting sick was a popular trick of female pickpockets, but nothing had been stolen from me. So the woman’s faked illness might just have been a ploy to entice me into having sex with her. I didn’t feel guilty. Actually, I felt rather good for having given her a good time. My wife would never know about the encounter. And even if she found out, it wouldn’t hurt my social position. I got home at about 9.30. My dreamlike adventure had lasted less than two hours.\n\nTwo days later, I read in the morning newspaper about the murder of the woman I had the sexual encounter with. The article filled about a quarter of a page and included a picture of the victim. Her name was",

But I had no choice.\n\nIn order to take a week off from work, I made up a story: my wife was ill, and I would be taking her to the Hanamaki hot springs, near her parents’ house. As fate would have it, I did in fact have to go to that area, so I would be able to stop to buy some souvenirs for my colleagues, which would make them believe that I really had been there. My story worked, and my boss allowed me to be away from the office for a week.\n\nOn the morning of 3rd April, I told my wife that I would be leaving on a business trip that evening and asked her to prepare enough rice balls to last me for three days. I packed the food, put a shovel in the trunk, and drove to the house in Kaminoge, where I found the corpses as instructed. The bodies were mutilated and resembled deformed children. I got the two corpses I was told to bury first, laid them in the trunk, and then drove west towards the Kansai area in the dark of night.\n\nI had to move quickly, because I knew that when decomposition set in, the stench would be unbearable; it would also attract attention. Furthermore, the possibility of a reinvestigation of Kazue’s house loomed. I needed to get the bodies out of there as fast as possible.\n\nTraffic checks were rare, but I had to take every possible precaution. I had my police identification ready, just in case. I loaded three extra containers of petrol. With luck, that would be enough fuel to reach my destination without having to stop for more. I didn’t want a petrol-station attendant remembering my face. As I drove, my mind raced. The order and place of burial for each body had been spelt out in detail. But what was the reason for that? Was it to make it seem like a serial killing",

The case fell under the jurisdiction of the Takanawa police station, and my colleague Ando distinguished himself by being the one to arrest her. Detectives celebrated the end of the case, and a festive mood lingered in our station for a while, bringing my conscience a little relief.\n\nIn June, I read a copy of Heikichi Umezawa’s note, which the investigation had distributed to each police station. I couldn’t see how he could have committed the Azoth murders. The killer did everything just the way he had described it, but he himself was dead by the time the murders took place. But if it hadn’t been him, then who had done it? It had to be one of his followers, someone intent on making Azoth himself. My God, I had lent my hand to a maniac!\n\nThere were so many questions. Was astrology behind the elaborate plot? Was it the killer’s idea to arrange when the bodies would be discovered? If so, why were the bodies in Kosaka, Yamato and Ikuno to be found later than the others? If delay of discovery was the objective, why not other mines or more distant places? Was there a pattern?\n\nThen there was that business about Chinese spies. If there was the least bit of truth to it, I had been drawn into the picture because of my encounter with Kazue. Was that all planned out ahead of time—just as the murders of the six girls were premeditated? If so, who would be the best person to bury the bodies? Of course, a police officer! He would",

        "md": "Of all these people, the one person who stands out is Tamio Yasukawa, the mannequin craftsman. However, it’s hard to believe that the investigators failed to include him among the suspects. Yasukawa lived in a dormitory located within a ten-minute walk from his workplace. He spent most of his free time with his co-workers. His alibi was not firm—he said he was at a movie—but he had known Heikichi only three months before the Azoth murders. Who would commit serial murders for a lunatic after knowing him just three months? And if he did do it, where could he have done it, and when?

To look for his double! He didn’t want his wife finding out his secret other studio, so he trapped her into being arrested. Yes, that’s it! It makes sense!”\n\n“Hmm, not so bad. If Heikichi was the sole killer, the case could be more easily solved. But too many things still don’t come together. For one, it’s unbelievable the family wouldn’t be able to recognize a double.”\n\n“What else?”\n\n“Wouldn’t he have wanted to finish his life’s work? Why was the twelfth painting left unfinished?”\n\n“In order to pretend he was killed.”\n\n“I thought you’d say that.”\n\n“Or Azoth could essentially have become his twelfth painting.”\n\n“Let me go on. Another question: why was Kazue killed?”\n\n“Because Heikichi wanted her house to create and store Azoth in…”\n\n“No!” said Kiyoshi vehemently. “I’m sure he would have looked for a better place near Mount Yahiko. There might have been a police stakeout at Kazue’s house. This is what you told me before, so don’t get lost",
        "md": "“In my opinion, there are only two remaining possibilities. One is something that goes beyond our reasoning powers up to now…”\n\n“Magic?”\n\n“Come on, Kiyoshi, you know I would never say that. What I’m saying is, it was done by an outsider—or outsiders—someone outside the family. The letter to Takegoshi might not have been a fake; the secret agency could have been waiting for the chance to kill the Umezawas. If that’s right, the case is out of our control.”\n\n“But we’ve already denied that possibility, haven’t we?” Kiyoshi replied.\n\n“OK. Yes, I guess so. The other idea is that Heikichi wasn’t killed after all. He could have disappeared by some kind of trickery and left his own prints in the snow. He had a double, who had no beard. He killed him, beating him beyond recognition. Then, his family wouldn’t have been able to identify him. This would explain why he spent most of his time in his studio.

It’s a story about a\nsnake, right? If you keep a snake in a safe, it will soon die from lack of\noxygen. And suppose it does survive in the box: snakes don’t drink milk.\nHave you ever seen any reptiles breast-feeding their babies? Only\nmammals do that. And how about a man whistling for a snake? Actually\nsnakes can’t be trained. They don’t have ears, so how can they respond to\na man’s commands? It’s a matter of common sense. Was Holmes stupid\nor what? Since the incidents were so unrealistic, I have to assume the\nstory was made up by Dr Watson. He wrote it as if he had been with\nHolmes, but probably Holmes just picked up the idea from something\nhe’d heard somewhere. Holmes was addicted to cocaine, and he could\nhave told Watson any old thing that came into his head. In fact, seeing\nsnakes is a good example of somebody hallucinating.”\n    “Holmes was able to guess a person’s occupation and personality at\nfirst glance. He was much more instinctive than you could ever be.”\n    “Oh, I can’t stand his guesswork! It’s so embarrassing! For example,\nin ‘The Adventure of the Yellow Face’, the client found a pipe, and\nHolmes guessed whose it was. According to Holmes, the owner had\ntreasured this pipe, because he had had it repaired, paying almost as\nmuch as the price of the pipe itself. Holmes also said that the owner was\nleft-handed because he lit the pipe with the flame of a lamp, not with\nmatches, holding the pipe in his left hand. Therefore, the pipe got burnt\non the right side, according to Holmes. Surely, if the pipe was so valuable\nto the owner, he would’ve been careful enough not to burn it. Anyway, if\nyou smoked a pipe, which hand would you use? You would rather not use\nyour dominant hand, especially if you smoke while doing something else.\nMany left-handed men might hold their pipe in their right hand. So we\ncan’t determine whether the man was left-handed or not. Only Watson\nwould have accepted Holmes’s dubious reasoning. Well, maybe it was\njust a joke—or an example of bad humour.\n    “What else?… Holmes was a master of disguise, wasn’t he?

Are you something to do with the police?”\n\nKiyoshi was as cool as could be. “Well,” he grinned, “what do we look like?”\n\n“May I see your business card?”\n\nI was a bit flustered by Okawa’s request, but Kiyoshi was on a roll. He knitted his brow and said to Okawa in a hushed voice, “To tell you the truth, Mr Okawa, we’re not allowed to present our business card to any civilian. I apologize. Have you heard of the Public Security Investigation Agency?”\n\n“Um, yeah, I think I’ve heard of it…” mumbled Okawa. It was his turn to look nervous.\n\n“Well…” Kiyoshi paused for a moment before continuing. “I shouldn’t have mentioned it, really. Please forget that I mentioned it at all. When can you find Mr Yasukawa’s current address?”\n\nOkawa’s attitude was suddenly cooperative. “I have to go to Takatsuki now, but I’ll be right back. I’ll get his address by 5 p.m. Could you call me around that time? I’ll give you my number…”\n\n“You were marvellous,” I whispered to Kiyoshi, as we walked back to the main street. “I didn’t know that you were a con man!”",

We were poor, but many people were very poor then, so I never felt humiliated about our living conditions.”\n\n“Did your father have any close friends?”\n\n“He gambled and drank with different people, but he had only one close friend, Shusai Yoshida. My father had great admiration for him.”\n\n“Is he still alive?”\n\n“Yes, he is.”\n\n“What does he do?”\n\n“I believe he’s a Chinese-style fortune-teller. He was probably about ten years younger than my father. They met in a bar in Tokyo.”\n\n“In Tokyo?”\n\n“Yes, that’s right.”\n\n“Was your father interested in fortune-telling, too?”\n\n“I don’t think so. My father liked Mr Yoshida because dollmaking was an interest they had in common.”\n\n“Doll-making?”",

I realized that I had been so absorbed in my thoughts I had forgotten to bring the customary gift. I apologized embarrassedly.\n\n“Oh, don’t worry about it,” Yoshida laughed, putting me at ease.\n\nThe shelves in the living room were full of books and dolls of various sizes; some were made of wood, some of synthetic resin.

Finally, I went to a first-floor coffee shop so that I could watch the passers-by without them seeing me. At 4.50 p.m., I could wait no longer. I dialled Yoshida’s number and was elated to hear that he had just returned home. I hung up the phone and ran out, barely missing a waitress with a tray of hot coffee.\n\nYasukawa’s daughter had said that Shusai Yoshida was about sixty; but his full head of grey hair made him look older than that. He greeted me politely and led me into the living room. As I sat on the sofa, I hastily recounted Bunjiro Takegoshi’s written confession and my conversation with Yasukawa’s daughter.\n\n“Mr Yasukawa seemed to think that Heikichi Umezawa was still alive. Do you think he lived? And if so, did he make Azoth?” I asked.\n\nLeaning back in his chair, Yoshida listened quietly and attentively. His appearance was pleasing—his grey hair framed his rather narrow face handsomely, and his eyes had a strong yet gentle quality. His posture was upright and he seemed in good health. Unexpectedly, he fit my image of a lone wolf.\n\n“I know about the case, of course,” he began. “I explored it with my fortune-telling techniques, but I couldn’t reach any conclusion about Heikichi Umezawa’s death.

        "md": "“Really? But where in Meiji-Mura is Azoth? Buried somewhere?”\n\n“Well, in the park there’s an old post office, from Uji-Yamada, which exhibits mementos of the Japanese postal service through the years. It includes mannequins of postmen in uniform from different periods, old-fashioned postboxes—that kind of thing.”\n\n“So it’s like a museum?”\n\n“Yes. Now in the exhibition there’s a single female mannequin, which has been placed in the corner. Yasukawa insisted that she was Azoth!”\n\n“Huh?… That’s unbelievable! But couldn’t we trace where it came from? That would be possible, wouldn’t it?”\n\n“Oh, there’s no need for you to trace its origin, Mr Ishioka. That was a project I was involved in personally. You see, I was on the team of the Owari Mannequin Company of Nagoya that travelled back and forth between Nagoya and Kyoto, making the mannequins for the village. But something mysterious did occur: on opening day, we noticed that a mannequin that we had not made had been added to the display. The craftsmen at Owari had no idea where it had come from. It was a mannequin of a woman. None of us had been asked to make a female mannequin, so we concluded that the administrators of Meiji-Mura had changed their minds and included one at the last moment. It’s not entirely crazy that Yasukawa thought it was Azoth, because the mannequin did have a very strange aspect about it.”\n\n“Were you at Meiji-Mura today to repair the mannequins?”\n\n“No. I went to see a friend, who used to be a fellow craftsman.

Despite his age and his tiny stature, he leapt up to grab the rope\nhanging from the pantograph like a frog leaping for a willow branch. His\nweight pulled it down. Then he ran beside the car as it turned on the\nturntable. He turned the pantograph in the opposite direction and then ran\nback to his seat. He signalled to the driver and the tram started up again\nvery slowly; it resembled a cow just waking up from a nap.\n    The elderly man’s brisk movements astonished me. Nobody seemed\nto be in a hurry at Meiji-Mura, and presumably there wasn’t a timetable,\nbut even so he seemed passionate about running the operation smoothly.\nI’m sure his family would have been worried if they could see how hard\nhe worked. Working like that would suggest that he didn’t suffer from\neither back pain or insomnia—but what if he had a heart attack while\njumping around? Well, I suppose that would be his fate. In fact, he would\nprobably be happier to die with the tram rope in his hands than peacefully\nin bed. I remembered what Shusai Yoshida had said about envying his\nfriend working in the village.

Sunlight was\nstreaming in through the high windows. Specks of dust were floating in\nthe air. I was the only one there.\n    The exhibition was arranged in chronological order, beginning with a\nmannequin of an express messenger who delivered letters on foot. Next,\nthere was the first postbox used by Japan’s postal system. That was\nfollowed by several different designs, ending with a familiar red postbox\nin the shape of a column. Then there was an exhibition of postmen in\ndifferent uniforms.\n    I was beginning to feel irritated. “Where is she?” I said to myself out\nloud. I turned to one side, and there, in a dark corner, was a female\nmannequin wearing a red kimono. Her black hair was in bangs.\n    Are you really her?",

    "text": "Emperor Meiji, that would’ve been different. That would have made me\nvery happy!” He laughed loudly.\n    “Excuse me, but could I ask you where you lived in 1936? I know it’s\nalmost forty years ago, but…”\n    “1936? Hmm… I was twenty… That was before the war, so I was\nliving in Takamatsu on the island of Shikoku. I worked at a liquor store.”\n    “Were you born in Takamatsu?”\n    “That’s right.”\n    “But you seem to have an Osaka dialect.”\n    “Oh, I lived in Osaka for long time, that’s why. When I left the\nmilitary, I couldn’t find a job in my hometown, so I moved to the big city.\nI was hired at another liquor store, but they went bankrupt. Since then,\nI’ve had many different kinds of jobs. At one time I pulled a stall around\nselling ramen noodles; another time, I worked in a mannequin factory.”\n    “Is that how you met Mr Yoshida?”\n    “No, no, I met him after I quit that job, when I was a security guard at\na building in Osaka. That was over ten years ago… no… must have been\nnearly twenty years ago. I knew a sculptor who was renting a space for\nhis artwork in the same building. We became friends, and he introduced\nme to a doll-making club in Kyoto. Shusai Yoshida was the person who\nstarted the club. He had just moved from Tokyo and was new to the area,\nso I offered to help if I could. Eventually, I became his doll-making\nassistant. He said that he was just doing it as a hobby, but he was too\nmodest. When it comes to doll-making, there is nobody better than him.\nThis is not just my personal opinion; all the experts say the same. He’s\nalmighty in the field. But his technique and artistry are especially\nbrilliant when it comes to creating the faces of Western-style dolls. For\nExpo ’70 in Osaka, he was asked to exhibit some of his dolls, and that\nwas when our friendship developed.

I know it’s almost forty years ago, but…”\n\n“1936? Hmm… I was twenty… That was before the war, so I was living in Takamatsu on the island of Shikoku. I worked at a liquor store.”\n\n“Were you born in Takamatsu?”\n\n“That’s right.”\n\n“But you seem to have an Osaka dialect.”\n\n“Oh, I lived in Osaka for long time, that’s why. When I left the military, I couldn’t find a job in my hometown, so I moved to the big city. I was hired at another liquor store, but they went bankrupt. Since then, I’ve had many different kinds of jobs. At one time I pulled a stall around selling ramen noodles; another time, I worked in a mannequin factory.”\n\n“Is that how you met Mr Yoshida?”\n\n“No, no, I met him after I quit that job, when I was a security guard at a building in Osaka. That was over ten years ago… no… must have been nearly twenty years ago. I knew a sculptor who was renting a space for his artwork in the same building. We became friends, and he introduced me to a doll-making club in Kyoto. Shusai Yoshida was the person who started the club. He had just moved from Tokyo and was new to the area, so I offered to help if I could. Eventually, I became his doll-making assistant. He said that he was just doing it as a hobby, but he was too modest. When it comes to doll-making, there is nobody better than him. This is not just my personal opinion; all the experts say the same. He’s almighty in the field. But his technique and artistry are especially brilliant when it comes to creating the faces of Western-style dolls. For Expo ’70 in Osaka, he was asked to exhibit some of his dolls, and that was when our friendship developed. In order to have everything ready by opening day, we sometimes had to work through the night. It was tough work, but I enjoyed working with him a lot.” It was true—Shusai Yoshida did have a certain charisma.\n\nI had seen it myself.

It would be tough to challenge a mind like that. I would have to pick up on something that only the culprit could have known. But his friend Yasukawa, who had known Heikichi, was now dead; Yoshida could always claim he had heard it from him. Dead men tell no tales, so I would have no way of determining the truth.\n\nI returned to Emoto’s apartment a little after 10 p.m. Kiyoshi wasn’t back, and Emoto was watching TV alone. I thanked him for the use of his car and gave him a little souvenir from Meiji-Mura. But I was too tired to tell him much about the place.

I felt my whole body\nbecome numb. “No, no, no, Kiyoshi. You’re exhausted. Calm down, calm\ndown!” I repeated the same words over and over again. I grabbed his\nshoulders, and then slowly pushed him back down onto the stone bench.\n    He finally settled down, and I began to breathe a little easier. I was\nstruck by the bitter irony of the situation: exhaustion and pressure had\ndriven     him    insane,     but   they    didn’t    seemed      to   have    helped  our\ninvestigation at all. I realized I shouldn’t have let him get involved in the\nwhole thing; I knew his mental health hadn’t been good. But he was the\none who had launched into the challenge with Takegoshi Jr. Now the\nresult was clear: Kiyoshi would suffer in defeat. It was hopeless.\nTakegoshi Jr had to do nothing but wait for us to come bowing and\nscraping and apologizing like pathetic fools. The mystery had been\nunsolved for forty years; we were crazy to think we could solve it in a\nweek. But I still held out the hope that Shusai Yoshida was really\nHeikichi Umezawa incarnated. It was only a glimmer of hope, but for\nsome reason I felt confident. In his state, however, Kiyoshi could not be\ntalked to rationally. I had to take immediate action, alone, even if I had to\nleave poor Kiyoshi alone on the brink of insanity. There were only a few\nhours left. I needed to catch Yoshida, for the sake of both of us.\n    It was now past 10 a.m. I was about to call Emoto for help, when\nKiyoshi started talking again.\n    “I shouldn’t have spoken ill of Sherlock Holmes. You were right,\nKazumi, I should have known my place. I thought it would be easy for\nme, and in fact, I was almost there. God, it’s all so simple—like\ndominoes. I just need to know where to hit them to start them falling. Just\none tile—that’s all I need—and then everything will fall into place! Shit!\nI’ve concentrated all my efforts on this, and now I’m losing it. I need\ninspiration. I need something, a little bit of something to inspire me.” He\nheld his head in his hands. “Ouch! This is great. You told me I would\nsuffer for my pride, and now I can feel my lips swelling up. I can barely\nmove them. How can I talk like this? I’ve lost my pace; it’s hopeless.\nYou, at least, seem to be doing very well. Tell me what you’ve\ndiscovered.”",
    "md": "machete? It must be getting rusty! I’ve got to find it. I’ve got to keep digging like a mole! Time is running out. It’s now or never!”\n\nThis was insanity; Kiyoshi was going insane. I felt my whole body become numb. “No, no, no, Kiyoshi. You’re exhausted. Calm down, calm down!” I repeated the same words over and over again. I grabbed his shoulders, and then slowly pushed him back down onto the stone bench.\n\nHe finally settled down, and I began to breathe a little easier. I was struck by the bitter irony of the situation: exhaustion and pressure had driven him insane, but they didn’t seem to have helped our investigation at all. I realized I shouldn’t have let him get involved in the whole thing; I knew his mental health hadn’t been good. But he was the one who had launched into the challenge with Takegoshi Jr. Now the result was clear: Kiyoshi would suffer in defeat. It was hopeless. Takegoshi Jr had to do nothing but wait for us to come bowing and scraping and apologizing like pathetic fools. The mystery had been unsolved for forty years; we were crazy to think we could solve it in a week. But I still held out the hope that Shusai Yoshida was really Heikichi Umezawa incarnated.

She is the culprit in the Tokyo Zodiac Murders…”\n\nI was speechless. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I thought I would faint. The moments of silence that followed Kiyoshi’s statement felt as long as forty years.\n\nSuddenly, a streak of lightning flashed through the teahouse and the silence was broken by a massive roar of thunder. The waitress tried to muffle her scream. Then there came the sound of large drops of rain beating on the roof, and within seconds the rain was falling in torrents.\n\nThe view through the window turned into a sumi-e ink painting as the rain drove against it. We could see people racing for shelter; some came dashing into the teahouse, clattering the sliding wooden door at the entrance and speaking in loud voices.\n\nI saw this all in a trance—as if all the things in the world were slowly vanishing. A great sense of exhaustion overtook me. I imagined a piece of paper burning and shrinking…\n\nIs Kiyoshi kidding me as usual?

Did it mean that the murders were committed by someone outside the family? But she only looked about fifty. At the time of the murders, she would have been only a child.

You’ll feel much better tomorrow,” Kiyoshi said, closing his eyes contentedly.\n\n“You’re enjoying watching me suffer, aren’t you?”\n\n“No, I’m not. My eyes are closed.”\n\nAfter a few seconds of that charade, Kiyoshi, miraculously rested, opened his eyes, took out the sachet that Taeko Sudo had given him and started to study it.\n\nThe sky was aglow with the setting sun. I thought of the storm at Arashiyama several hours ago. I thought of the last seven days in Kyoto. Different places, different people, so many different things. All in one week.\n\n“I guess all my running around was useless, then, huh?”",

I solved the mystery; that’s all. I don’t want to be decorated! What a bore! Good paintings don’t need to be framed, you know… The thought that I’m going to help that thug of a cop disgusts me. If I didn’t care about his father, I wouldn’t tell him anything. People, huh!”\n\nMrs Iida phoned a little after noon. She said she and her brother would arrive in about an hour. While we waited, Kiyoshi drew some diagrams in a notebook.\n\nFinally, there was a knock on the door.\n\n“Hello, please come in,” Kiyoshi said. He looked perplexed when Mrs Iida entered with someone else, not her brother. “Oh, where’s Fumihiko? Isn’t he coming?”\n\n“He wasn’t able to come today, so my husband has accompanied me. This is Mr Iida.”\n\nIida bowed to us twice. He was a modest-looking man who looked more like the manager of a kimono shop than a detective.\n\n“He is with the police department, too, so there should be no problem,” Mrs Iida continued. “I also wish to apologize for my brother’s rudeness when he met you, Mr Mitarai. I regret that very much.”\n\n“Well, I am also sorry he couldn’t be here,” Kiyoshi replied, trying to contain his sarcasm. “I wonder if he would have been absent if I had failed to solve the case. Well, we must understand that a man in such a high position is always busy. Mr Ishioka, aren’t you fixing coffee for us?”\n\nI hurried off to the kitchen.",

Bunjiro Takegoshi entered Kazue’s house at around 7.30 p.m. and left near 8.50 p.m. The presumed time of Kazue’s death was between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. How was this possible? Again the answer is quite simple: Kazue was already dead when Mr Takegoshi entered her house.

The image of her mysterious smile has held people in thrall for forty years, as if the art of the Renaissance painter was the trick. In this case, the killer used perspective to draw the perfect picture of the murders. But Azoth existed only at the vanishing point. Nobody ever considered the possibility that the girl whose head was missing could be still alive. That’s right—Azoth was never created, even in the killer’s mind; moreover, she was never meant to exist.\n\n“Well, I’m sure you can untangle the rest of the mystery yourselves. Thank you for listening.”\n\nFor a moment, the three of us sat there, stupefied.\n\nThen I shouted out, “Wait! You can’t stop now!”\n\nI had more questions than I knew how to ask. Kiyoshi, who was feigning boredom, simply grinned. He took his time sipping his coffee.",

If\nthey had had all six bodies they might have compared the surfaces of all\nthe cuts and discovered the exact combination—although the clothing\nmight have impaired their judgement. Needless to say, this trick would\nnot have worked in any country where bodies are buried rather than\ncremated.\n    “Tokiko chose Tomoko’s body to be found first, because it really was\nTomoko’s, although missing her lower legs and feet. It would be\nidentified as Tomoko right away. That’s why it was left on the ground—\nto facilitate discovery. On the other hand, the body identified as Tokiko\nwas in fact Yukiko’s—without her head. Tokiko knew that a headless\nbody would be subject to very careful examination, so she arranged for it\nto be found later—but not the last. If Tomoko was found first, Akiko and\nTokiko would probably be next, followed by Yukiko, Nobuyo and Reiko.\nThat was the desired sequence because by the time the last three bodies\nwere discovered, the sawed body parts would have rotted and they would\nbe more or less reduced to skeletons.\n    “The segmentation and sequence would work very effectively,\nbecause either the upper or lower part of each victim would have been\ncremated      before    the    rest   of   her   body    was     discovered.  And  the\ninvestigators wouldn’t realize that the combination of upper and lower\nbody parts was wrong, even if the first three bodies found were put\ntogether in one place.\n    “Yukiko’s body—which was misidentified as Tokiko’s—was not\ndeeply buried. But the body parts identified as Yukiko’s were buried very\ndeep. That’s how the fraud was achieved.”\n    “How did Tokiko ensure that Yukiko’s body would be misidentified as\nher body?” I asked next.\n    “Well, Yukiko’s feet had been disfigured from years of ballet dancing;\nthat was one point for identification, but it wouldn’t be sufficient. So\nTokiko cleverly prepared false evidence. In Heikichi’s note she described\nherself as having a birthmark; in fact, it was Yukiko who had the\nbirthmark on the right side of her stomach.

    "text": "the beginning, I told you all I knew about the case, but there wasn’t\nenough there, was there?”\n     “You’re right. You told me about the case from an incorrect\nassumption: that Azoth was created. When I considered all the facts, I\ncouldn’t find anyone who had enough time or space to do that. But\nwhether or not Azoth was created didn’t matter. The crucial key was\nHeikichi’s note. Many descriptions in it didn’t quite make sense to me, so\nI got suspicious.”\n     “For example?”\n     “There were lots of things… First of all, one thing was fundamentally\nwrong. In the note, ‘Heikichi’ said it was not for publication and it should\nbe placed with Azoth in the centre of Japan. On the other hand, he said\nthat if Azoth made money, it must go to Tae. That proved he really\nwanted someone to read the note.\n     “Second, the killer ought to have taken the note with him, but he\ndidn’t. Without it, how could he give directions to Takegoshi? If Heikichi\nreally had written the note, the killer would have needed to have copied it\nor memorized it. Anyway, to conceal his crime, the killer wouldn’t have\nleft it. The killer obviously left the note so that the public would see it.\n     “Third, the author said something about Azoth making a fortune. That\nstruck me as odd. Azoth was going to be created to save the Japanese\nEmpire, not to benefit a specific individual. And then the author said that\npart about the money going to Tae. I should have noticed that earlier.\n     “There were other things. Heikichi was a chain-smoker, but the note\nsaid he didn’t like going to nightclubs because he didn’t like the smoky\nair. Tokiko was writing about herself there!\n     “What else?… Oh yes, the music. The author said he liked ‘Isle of\nCapri’ and ‘Orchids in the Moonlight’. They were hit songs in 1934 and\n1935. I used to collect music from that period, so I know them very well.\nAnother big hit was ‘Yira, Yira’, by Carlos Gardel—well, it doesn’t\nreally matter. The year 1935 was the year before Heikichi’s death. By\nthat time, he had already locked himself up in his studio, and we know he\ndidn’t have a radio or a phonograph. So he had no way to listen to the\nlatest hits; he could never have sung them. But the songs would have\nbeen familiar to Tokiko, because Masako loved to play music in the main\nhouse.”",

The year 1935 was the year before Heikichi’s death. By that time, he had already locked himself up in his studio, and we know he didn’t have a radio or a phonograph.

And I can overcome any loneliness I may feel because you are here!”\n\nKiyoshi’s warm words were unexpected, and they made me so happy. Now was the time to reveal my plan to him. I tried to say it with all seriousness, but I couldn’t help smiling. “What would you say if I told you I wanted to write a novel based on this case?” Kiyoshi stiffened as if he’d been caught with his hand in the biscuit jar. “Bad joke, Mr Ishioka!”\n\n“I don’t know if any publisher will like it, but I think it’d be worthwhile trying.”\n\n“I would endure almost anything, my friend,” Kiyoshi said quietly, “but please, keep this quiet. No book!”",

    "text": "primary school. I was one year ahead of her, but being in the same school\nwith her made me feel second-rate. I had to wear moth-eaten sweaters\nand stained blouses and skirts, while she was always dressed neatly with\nnew clothes. In order to forget my misery, I studied fiercely. I began to\nget higher scores than Yukiko. So Masako and Yukiko employed every\ntrick they could think of to interrupt me when I was studying.\n    If Masako didn’t like me, why did she keep me in her house? Perhaps\nshe was afraid of looking bad in front of the neighbours, or perhaps she\nenjoyed using me as a maid. All the household chores were mine from\nthe time I was small. I asked if I could go and live with my mother, but\nMasako wouldn’t allow it. Neither our neighbours nor my classmates\nknew      what    was    happening       inside    the    Umezawa        household;  they\nconcealed the facts so well.\n    Every time I was getting ready to visit my mother, Masako and her\ndaughters would do nasty things to thwart me. But it never stopped me\nfrom going out. The real reason was not so much that I wanted to see my\nmother, but that I had found a job secretly. I had to help support my\nmother and myself. She could not make ends meet from just selling\ncigarettes.\n    My mother, who understood my situation very well, helped me keep\nmy job a secret. Sometimes the Umezawa women asked her if I was\nreally visiting her in Hoya. She always evaded their questions. Back then,\nwomen couldn’t get a job, even at nightclubs, without references. I was\nlucky; I met a kind gentleman. With his help, I started to work once a\nweek at a university hospital.

After putting my handbag under the eaves,\nwhere there was no snow, I threw a rope I’d prepared to the sliding bar\nfrom the window and managed to hook it and then pull it to lock the\ndoor. Then I walked to the street, carrying Heikichi’s shoes with me. My\nshoe prints were in plain sight in the snow; I intended to create a second\nset of prints on top of them using his shoes. Stepping carefully on my\ntoes into the set of prints I’d just made, I walked back to the studio. But\nwhen I looked closely, I could see indentations in the centre of my\noriginal shoe prints. I had to disguise them somehow. I put my father’s\nshoes on and tried my best to walk over my first set of prints normally.\nWhen I got back to the street, I changed shoes again and put my father’s\nshoes in a bag. If it hadn’t snowed so much, and again in the morning, the\nwhole trick might not have worked.\n    I hid in the woods in Komazawa that night. There was a place I knew\nwell near the creek; it was a low spot covered with thorny vines. The\nthorns pricked me painfully, but it was the perfect place to hide. If my\nplan failed, I decided I would kill myself there. I had already dug a hole\nready and covered it with old branches and grass. That’s where I buried\nthe box, the scissors and the whiskers from Heikichi’s beard. I waited for\nmorning to come, sitting in the middle of the bushes. If I walked around,\nsomeone might see me, which would be the worst possible thing that\ncould happen. A few cars passed during the night, but I was lucky not to\nbe seen by anyone.\n    It was so cold that I thought I would die. While sitting there, I was\nseized with regret and uncertainty. Should I go home while it was\nsnowing? I decided I shouldn’t—I had to avoid being seen by anyone. I\nhad told Masako I would be spending the night in Hoya.

I never liked spending time with\nthe Umezawa women, but going to Mount Yahiko with them was part of\nmy plan, and I was looking forward to it. Fortunately, the police hadn’t\nreleased Heikichi’s note, so nobody knew about the Azoth story. This\ntime, everything worked smoothly.

The shop\nwas still there, but not her. All the stores on the street now had modern\naluminium windows and doors, making my mother’s old, worn cigarette\nshop look very pitiful. No one was minding the shop. I slid the window\nopen and called out to see if there was anybody there.

    "text": "         Did you know?\nThe Tokyo Zodiac Murders belongs to the popular Japanese honkaku, “orthodox” or “authentic”,\nsubgenre of murder mysteries. Unlike psychological thrillers, honkaku books focus on plotting\nand clues. The reader is not deceived by the author but actively drawn into the writing and\nencouraged to participate in the solving of the mystery. These “pure” mysteries also stay away\nfrom social criticism, drawing their inspiration from writers such as Arthur Conan Doyle and\nEdgar Allan Poe, whose works inspired the Golden Age of Detective Fiction in Britain, and with\nwhom Shimada has been compared for the complexity of his plots and the elegance of their\nsolutions.\n    Shimada studied design at university, where he also developed an interest in astrology, but he\nturned his attention to crime writing in 1981, after witnessing a bank robbery. He has written over\n100 works, including novels, short stories and essays, and has become so popular in Japan that he\ntemporarily moved to Los Angeles to escape his fame. He’s also a guitar player and often peppers\nhis interviews and book signings with a tune or two. He even released a rock album in 1976!\n    The Tokyo Zodiac Murders is the first story to star Kiyoshi Mitarai, and Shimada has\ncontinued the detective’s fictional career throughout more than two dozen novels since.
