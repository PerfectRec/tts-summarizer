We investigate\n           the effects on savings behavior and downstream outcomes such as assets and trust.\n           We find, on average, no significant impact on overall savings or downstream\n           outcomes. However, among individuals with nonpositive balances prior to the\n           offering, we observe an increase in balances in savings accounts and in the\n           transactional accounts in which the subsidies were initially deposited. These\n           findings underscore the potential of using bank accounts to encourage savings,\n           particularly for individuals with limited prior savings.\n\n           JEL classifications: G20, D14, E21\n           Keywords: Financial access, Banking accounts, Savings\n\n*  Banerjee:    MIT,    banerjee@mit.edu;       Martínez    A.:   IDB,    claudiam@iadb.org;       Puentes:    University    of  Chile,\nepuentes@econ.uchile.cl.

Insufficient savings not only make individuals more vulnerable but hinder\ntheir ability to invest and improve their financial well-being. Furthermore, a significant portion of\nthe global population still lacks access to formal financial services, including bank accounts. In\nLatin America, for instance, while there is relatively high access to the formal financial sector,\nwith 74 percent of individuals owning a bank account, only 18 percent of them use their accounts\nfor savings (Demirgüç-Kunt et al., 2022). These findings underscore the need to address low\nsavings rates and promote financial inclusion.\n          In collaboration with the Chilean government and BancoEstado, a state-owned bank, we\nevaluated a governmental initiative that transformed the payment method of transfers within the\nChilean conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, Programa Puente (PP).

For example, CCT\nprograms in Brazil, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Peru have paid their transfers through\nbank accounts. Among the potential advantages of using bank accounts, the first is that paying\ntransfers through bank accounts can enhance safety and reduce corruption risks as a step toward a\nsecure payment infrastructure that can decrease leakage (Muralidharan et al., 2014). Second, using\nbank accounts can offer faster and more cost-effective processing for the government.

However, transferring them through bank accounts decreases government expenses by\nUS$0.67 per transaction.\n          Third, bank account–based cash transfer payments can provide convenience to recipients\nand reduce travel costs. Instead of dealing with cash, beneficiaries can access their funds securely\nand conveniently through various banking channels, such as ATMs or online platforms. This\neliminates the need to travel to payment centers (Dupas and Robinson, 2013). It also could help\nprotect beneficiaries’ savings from the demands of family or friends (Dupas and Robinson, 2013)\nand solve self-control problems—for example, by decreasing consumption of temptation goods\n(Bachas et al., 2021).\n          Finally, adopting bank accounts for cash transfer payments, or eventually payment of all\ngovernment subsidies, can promote financial inclusion. For individuals who previously lacked\naccess to formal financial services, receiving transfers through bank accounts serves as a gateway\nto accessing a range of financial services, such as savings accounts, credit, and insurance products.\n          The literature finds that offering financial access has no or small positive effects on savings\n(Bachas et al., 2021; Dupas and Robinson, 2013; Pomeranz and Kast, 2022; Prina, 2015).\nFurthermore, in Chile, low take-up of savings accounts has prevented evaluation of such offerings\n(Dupas et al., 2018).

        "md": "Among the potential advantages of using bank accounts, the first is that paying transfers through bank accounts can enhance safety and reduce corruption risks as a step toward a secure payment infrastructure that can decrease leakage (Muralidharan et al., 2014). Second, using bank accounts can offer faster and more cost-effective processing for the government. In Chile, there is no evidence of corruption and leakage in disbursement of transfers through cashiers’ offices. However, transferring them through bank accounts decreases government expenses by US$0.67 per transaction.\n\nThird, bank account–based cash transfer payments can provide convenience to recipients and reduce travel costs. Instead of dealing with cash, beneficiaries can access their funds securely and conveniently through various banking channels, such as ATMs or online platforms. This eliminates the need to travel to payment centers (Dupas and Robinson, 2013).

All of CC participant’s subsidies (not only PP subsidies) were\nreceived in a CuentaRUT account if they accepted the offer to participate in CC. The CuentaRUT\naccounts, which were opened for beneficiaries who did not already have one, do not involve any\ninterest or opening cost. However, there are transactional costs associated with them.2\n\n2.2 Experimental Design\nFor the evaluation, the research team, in collaboration with the Ministry of Social Development,\nchose five municipalities3 in greater Santiago based on two criteria: i) sufficient physical capacity\nin BancoEstado’s branches to accommodate customers and ii) enough families participating in PP\nto allow us to implement the evaluation.\n          The treatment group was provided with the option to receive transfers through a bank\naccount, whereas control group participants had to request this option if they desired it. We\nstratified the sample on age,4 social security index score (SSI),5 duration of program participation,\nand municipality. Stratifying by age addressed concerns related to older beneficiaries’ familiarity\nwith banking systems, while SSI indicated vulnerability and potential financial access. The\nduration of program participation reflected the remaining transfer period, and municipality\naddressed variations in banking facilities’ availability across locations.\n          The     research      team    randomly        selected     individuals       to   participate      in   CC.   Selected\nbeneficiaries were visited by apoyos familiares at their home or workplace.

Although we lack data on whether individuals had a CuentaRUT or a savings\n account before the program, we can calculate the percentage of individuals that had positive\n balances in CuentaRUT or savings accounts prior to the intervention (Panel B). In the control\n group, 54 percent of individuals had positive balances in a CuentaRUT before treatment, while in\n the treatment group the figure was 52 percent. Regarding savings accounts, 72 percent of the\n control group had a positive balance, compared to 73 percent in the treatment group. We also\n calculated the number of individuals who had positive balances in CuentaRUT or savings accounts\n prior to the offering, which was 85 percent for both the treatment and control groups. All these\n figures are balanced across treatment and control groups.\n                    Analyzing the administrative data from the Ministry of Social Development (Panel C in\n Table 2), we observe that, on average, 85 percent of the sample consists of female participants who\n are around 36 years old and the average household size is 3.7 members.

In Panel\nA, we find that the treatment group showed a 12-percentage point (pp.) increase in individuals\nwith CuentaRUT compared to the control group, of whom 75.4 percent had a CuentaRUT account.\n\n 6 The strata consider four groups of SSI. We also control for the SSI index, a continuous variable. This variable\nprovides information within each strata cell.\n 7 We perform the analysis without including the average of the dependent variable before the offering and the results\nare similar and available upon request.\n 8 Individuals without prior balances tended to be older, more likely to be male, and resided in larger households\ncompared to those who had balances before the intervention.\n 9 If no one from the same cohort and municipality was offered the program, we did not impute an offering date. There\n are 15 individuals from the treatment group who were excluded from the analysis for this reason.

The least liked aspect of the program was the charges for transfers and balance inquiries, mentioned by 63 percent of participants.\n\nThe variable, Compound interest, is a binary variable indicating a preference for an annual interest rate of 24 percent over a monthly interest rate of 2 percent.",
        "md": "Trust, with 39 percent of the control group expressing trust in the institution, compared to 11 percent for other banks.\n\nIn addition, we examine whether the program affected participants’ fear of theft. Treated individuals no longer need to withdraw and carry large amounts of cash, which could reduce their fear of theft. In the follow-up survey, participants who entered the CC program were asked about their favorite aspect of it. The primary response was the enhanced sense of security, particularly the reduced risk of being robbed by not receiving resources in cash.11 We use a dummy variable for which 1 indicates high fear of being robbed and 0 indicates low or no fear. We do not find a significant impact of the program on participants’ fear of theft.\n\nWe investigate the program’s impact on temptation-related expenses, following the finding of Bachas et al. (2021) of reduced expenses with debit card monitoring. Our results indicate a small, nonsignificant negative impact. Additionally, we examine the effect of direct transfers to CuentaRUT on transportation costs, as participants no longer needed to visit a branch for withdrawals. Although our findings suggest a potential 13 percent decrease in transportation costs, this effect lacks statistical significance.\n\nFinally, we investigate the impact of the program on financial knowledge, considering the potential enhancement resulting from access to financial products (Hilgert et al., 2003). We find that 13 percent of individuals in the control group mistakenly believe that CuentaRUT does not have associated costs, while this figure decreases by 5 pp. in the treatment group. This indicates improved knowledge of CuentaRUT rules among treated individuals. However, when assessing knowledge of compound interest, we find no significant effect.12 These results suggest that the program enhances only aspects of financial knowledge directly related to the account used.\n\nNext, we estimate the effect of CC using data from BancoEstado. In Figure 1, we present the effects of CC on CuentaRUT balances (Panel A), savings account balances (Panel B), and the combined balances of both account types (Panel C). We observe that these variables were balanced before the program offering.\n\nAmong all respondents, 41.3 percent mentioned the enhanced sense of security, 31 percent indicated more convenience in withdrawing cash from various locations, and 11.1 percent appreciated the faster access to money without waiting in queues.

We also control for Social Security Index score (as a significant predictor of attrition in our sample), calendar-month fixed effects, and a dummy to account for the number of children between zero and five years old, which is unbalanced at baseline. In the case of post-enrollment regressions, we also include the baseline value of the dependent variable. We use robust standard errors.",
