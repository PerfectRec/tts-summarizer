These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\n depicted in Figure 2.\n Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\n subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\n\n                                 MultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)W O\n                                                where headi = Attention(QW i Q, KW i K, V W i V)\n\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W i ∈ Rdmodel×dk , W i ∈ Rdmodel×dk , W i ∈ Rdmodel×dvQ        K  V\n and W O ∈ Rhdv ×dmodel .\n In this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\n dk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\n is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n\n 3.2.3       Applications of Attention in our Model\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n\n            • In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\n               and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\n               position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\n               typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n               [38, 2, 9].\n            • The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\n               and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\n               encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\n               encoder.\n            • Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\n               all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\n               information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property.

One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\n\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9].\n\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n\nPE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\n\nPE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\n\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PE(pos+k) can be represented as a linear function of PE(pos).\n\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.",

    "text": " length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\n sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n [38 ] and byte-pair [31 ] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\n the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\n path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\n positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\n or O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\n between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\n recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6 ], however, decrease the complexity\n considerably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\n convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\n the approach we take in our model.\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\n from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\n heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\n and semantic structure of the sentences.\n\n 5    Training\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\n\n 5.1    Training Data and Batching\n\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\n sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\n target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\n 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\nvocabulary [38 ]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\n batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\n target tokens.\n\n 5.2    Hardware and Schedule\n\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\n the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\n trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\n bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\n(3.5 days).\n\n 5.3    Optimizer\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\n rate over the course of training, according to the formula:\n\n                  lrate = dmodel −0.5· min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)                      (3)\n\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\n and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number.

The configuration of this model is\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\nthe competitive models.\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [ 38 ]. These hyperparameters\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set.

The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\n\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38].
