At a mean age of 82, approximately 60% of trained participants, versus 50% of controls (P < .05), were at or above their baseline level of self-reported I.A.D.L function at 10 years. The reasoning and speed-of-processing interventions maintained their effects on their targeted cognitive abilities at 10 years (reasoning: effect size = 0.23, 99% C.I = 0.09–0.38; speed of processing: effect size = 0.66, 99% C.I = 0.43–0.88). Memory training effects were no longer maintained for memory performance. Booster training produced additional and durable improvement for the reasoning intervention for reasoning performance (effect size = 0.21, 99% C.I = 0.01–0.41) and the speed-of-processing intervention for speed-of-processing performance (effect size = 0.62, 99% C.I = 0.31–0.93).\nCONCLUSION: Each Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly cognitive intervention resulted in less decline in self-reported I.A.D.L compared with the control group. Reasoning and speed, but not memory, training resulted in improved targeted cognitive abilities for 10 years.",
